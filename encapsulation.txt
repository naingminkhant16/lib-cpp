Encapsulation
=============

Encapsulation is one of the features of Object-Oriented Programming.
Encapsulation can be defined as setting the data of a class as private properties and manipulate them by using class functions.
Those class functions can only be accessed by an object of its class and must use only member variables.
If there is no function inside the class that is using the member variable of the class, it cannot be called encapsulation.
By using encapsulation, the security of class data can be increased and it also helps to control the modification of class data members.
