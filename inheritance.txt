Inheritance
===========

One class cannot access the properties and methods of another class without a relationship.
In this case, Inheritance can be used as a relationship between classes.
Inheritance is one of the most important features of Object-Oriented Programming.
It is just like a Parent-Child relationship which means Child has the ability to derive the parent's possession.
By implementing Inheritance, the derived class(child class) will have the ability to access the properties of the base class (parent class) except private properties,
without changing the properties of the base class and may add new features to its own.
These new features in the derived class will not affect the base class.
The derived class now is said to be inherited from the base class.
There are basically three types of Inheritance in C++, which are Single Inheritance, Multi-Level Inheritance, and Multiple Inheritance.
If a derived class has only one base class(parent class), it can be called Single Inheritance.
One derived class can inherit from more than one class, and it is known as Multiple Inheritance.
If a derived class is created from another derived class, it is said to be Multi-Level Inheritance.
